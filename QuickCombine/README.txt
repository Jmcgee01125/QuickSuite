QuickCombine Version 1.4

:: -------------------------------------

QuickCombine allows easily appending videos to each other, forming one continuous clip.

:: -------------------------------------

To use, select all of the videos you want to combine and drag them onto QuickCombine.bat
	You will then be able to select which video comes in which order.
	Enter the number (such as "2") of the video in the list given, then press enter.
	Do not enter a blank, even if the argument order is the intended order, numbers must be entered.

You are responsible for making sure that all items are videos and have the same file extension.

The output will be saved as QuickCombine_output.<ext>

:: -------------------------------------

By opening QuickCombine.bat, one variable becomes available:
	ext - Output file type, should match the source files that you're using (default: mp4).
