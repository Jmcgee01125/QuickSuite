QuickCrop is a simple method of removing letter/pillarboxing from a video file.

To use, drag the video file onto QuickCrop.bat.
	If ConfirmResolution is 1, then it will ask if the detected crop resolution is correct and offer to change it.

The output will be saved as <source file>_qcr.<source filetype>
