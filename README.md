# QuickSuite
A collection of batch tools to do various menial tasks quickly.

---------------------

Current tools:

QuickConv: converts a series of images (0001.png, 0002.png, etc) into a video file.

QuickCompress: drag a video onto this to automatically compress it below a certain size. Useful for sending videos on size-restricted platforms like Discord.

QuickNote: allows creating a notes file into a directory from anywhere, without having to save-as.

---------------------

TODO: Write a full-length description here and give better documentation for all scripts.
  (Would have done that earlier but the people want what the people want, and that is access now).

---------------------

!! YOU MUST INSTALL FFMPEG TO USE QUICKCONV AND QUICKCOMPRESS

You can download FFmpeg from https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows (directs to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

Make sure to add it to your system's PATH variable. The guide covers this as well, or you can go edit environment variables yourself.


I've also included ffmpeg.exe (Version 2021-2-20) in the repo. You can download that as well if you're not comfortable with editing PATH.

This exe will need to be in the SAME DIRECTORY as any batch file using it. Otherwise it won't work.
