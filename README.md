# QuickSuite
A collection of batch tools to do various menial tasks quickly.

---------------------

Current tools:

QuickConv: converts a series of images (0001.png, 0002.png, etc) into a video file.

QuickCompress: drag a video onto this to automatically compress it below a certain size. Useful for sending videos on size-restricted platforms like Discord.

QuickNote: allows creating a notes file into a directory from anywhere, without having to save-as.

---------------------

TODO: Write a full-length description here and give better documentation for all scripts.
  (Would have done that earlier but the people want what the people want, and that is access now).

---------------------

!! YOU MUST INSTALL FFMPEG TO USE QUICKCONV AND QUICKCOMPRESS

You can download FFmpeg from https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows (directs to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

Make sure to add it to your system's PATH variable. The guide covers this as well, or you can go edit environment variables yourself.

I may package FFmpeg with this tool in the future, but for now the above will work.
