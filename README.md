# QuickSuite
A bunch of batch tools to do various menial tasks quickly.

---------------------

TODO: Write an actual description here and give better documentation for all scripts.
  (Would have done that earlier but the people want what the people want, and that is access now).

!! YOU MUST INSTALL FFMPEG TO USE QUICKCONV AND QUICKCOMPRESS
You can download FFmpeg from https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows (directs to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
Make sure to add it to your system's PATH variable. The guide covers this as well, or you can go edit environment variables yourself.

I may package FFmpeg with this tool in the future, but for now the above will work.
